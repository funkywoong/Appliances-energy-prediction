# Appliances-energy-prediction
# Objective
This repository deals with an analysis of ‘Appliances energy prediction’ using public dataset. That contains the measurement value of each room placed in a low energy building. The main purpose of this task be broken down into 3 subtasks. -Data exploration(preprocessing), Feature engineering, Model designing- When I was in each set stage, I focused on increasing model. So, I believe these all subtasks may be operated for the paper’s final goal.

# Getting Started
1. Unzip the 'ML-assignment2-2014143073.zip'
2. Install the required python packages
  - `pip install numpy --user`
  - `pip install pandas --user`
