# Appliances-energy-prediction
# Objective
This repository deals with an analysis of ‘Appliances energy prediction’ using public dataset. That contains the measurement value of each room placed in a low energy building. The main purpose of this task be broken down into 3 subtasks. -Data exploration(preprocessing), Feature engineering, Model designing- When I was in each set stage, I focused on increasing model. So, I believe these all subtasks may be operated for the paper’s final goal.

# Getting Started
1. Unzip the 'ML-assignment2-2014143073.zip'
2. Install the required python packages
  - `pip install numpy --user`
  - `pip install pandas --user`
  - `pip install datetime --user`
  - `pip install scikit-learn`
  - `pip install jupyter-notebook --user` (optional)
3. Execute the 'trainig.py' script in a root directory on your shell
  - `python training.py`

# Requirements
You need Python 3.5 or later to run ML-assignment2-2014143073.

For macOS or Windows, packages are available at
https://www.python.org/getit/

# Addition
You can get the performance of given model to just execute 'training.py'. But if you want to let you know about the development process and the data exploration, you have to launch the jupyter notebook IDE, and take a look 'EDA.ipynb' file.
